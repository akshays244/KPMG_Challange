terraform init
The first thing that you do after writing your code in Terraform is initializing the code using the command terraform init.

terraform plan
After a successful initialization of the working directory and the completion of the plugin download, we can create an execution plan using terraform plan command

terraform apply
Terraform apply command is used to create or introduce changes to real infrastructure. By default, apply scans the current working directory for the configuration and applies the changes appropriately. However, youâ€™ll optionally give the path to a saved plan file that was previously created with terraform plan.
